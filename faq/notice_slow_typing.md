# Caution: Slow Typing While Learning

For many years I have let myself practice bad typing skills and though I have attempted to use homerow in the past it never worked out because lessons always showed the finger placement and then started out with full alphabet practice.

When I discovered www.typingclub.com I was intrigued that it enforced good habits by teaching a letter or two at a time. I am dedicating June, and maybe longer to typing with standard homerow finger placement as I honestly feel it will improve my typing speeds drastically. Even if I can retrain my fingers to get the same typing speed this will be worth.

## Why are you typing slowly?

I am using homerow finger placement as much as possible which requires constant thought and effort to ensure I use the correct finger and do not let bad habits reform themselves.

## Why are you doing this?

* Increase typing accuracy
* Increase typing speed
* Decrease typing fatigue
* Because typing fast would be useful (and fun)

## Did you just retype a word without change?

I probably erased a word that was spelled correctly however I noticed that I used a wrong finger for a letter. To ensure the right habits are built - I will retype those words when I notice.
