# Profesional Work-Work Stream

Thankfully RescueTime allow me to stream some of my daily work. This is my day job and it is what pays the bills. Therefore I must remained focused on tasks at hand. If you have a suggestion or question about what I'm doing, professional programming or something else about RescueTime I'd be happy to answer.

I however will note be taking questions about my Indie Adventure, Game Development or Sim Racing activities during this time. I am at work and I must remain focused.
