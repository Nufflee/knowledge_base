# Putting Rally of Rockets on Hold

**Farewell-for-now Rally of Rockets playtest will be held April 6th 2019 at 9am ET.**

Turtles watching the stream from late December on will already know I was stressed with art direction, cost and my confidence in making enough sales to make back the cost. Rally of Rockets was initially started as a 4 month, stepping-stone project toward my main dream of creating an online multiplayer physically accurate racing simulator. So, I'm doing just that, creating my dream project.

## Why Not Finish Rally of Rockets

* It would take at least 6 months to wrap up MVP to early access point.
* At _least_ 12 additional months of development after early access is required.
* My art capabilities will not fulfill the vision I see of the project.
* Paying for art for that vision will not be cheap.
* I am not yet confident in my ability to make enough sales to recover art costs.
* I am confident in making sales with enough time and effort; being persistent.
	* Rally of Rockets is NOT my forever project, and "enough time" fails.

## What is the plan?

1. Wrap up Rally of Rockets with a farewell-for-now playtest.
	* Finish the keybinding system in Rally of Rockets.
	* Fix up the particle issues and graphics issues players have.
	* Farewell-for-now playtest April 6th, 9am
2. Do some quick cleanup and preparation work of TurtleBrains / ICE.
3. Begin the actual, _yet named_, Racing Simulator project.
4. Start with using Bullet physics and bits of Rally of Rockets where possible.
	* Not aiming for realistic physics here, just drivable - will be replaced.
5. Get the simulator running playtests like Rally of Rockets did ASAP.

## What changes are happening with your stream/development process?

Almost nothing with the exception of the project name and goals to be realistic & immersive.

* I will still use TurtleBrains / ICE (Custom C++ Frameworks)
* I plan to get playtest running before Fall 2019
* From time to time small projects will still occur, like Archer, Tombstone Boo!

## Won't the Racing Simulator take longer and cost more?

Yes. Definitely, yes. However I'm able and willing to put the enourmous amounts of extended time and effort to be persistent with the Racing Simulator. I believe constant updates with new features and content will bring the players in over time. If I am to be spending years on a project, it might as well be my dreaming project, _the racing simulator_, rather than the stepping stone project. Remember Rally of Rockets was meant to be a step towards the dream.
