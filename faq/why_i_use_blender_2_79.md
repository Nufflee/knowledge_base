# Why Blender 2.79 is Being Used

Blender 2.8 looks amazing, I **really** look forward to trying out. However I do not think it is wise from business perspective to use beta software that outright claims "Use at your own risk" and states files may be corrupted. Perhaps that is rare, I certianly hope it is. But even rare; that could potentially lose work.

Yes I could use backups with source control, there is potential for auto-save, etc. But it clearly isn't ready for production use with those message.

Also:
- Files are not backwards compatible with 2.79, which means using 2.80 is all or nothing.
- 2.79 is solid and stable, and works; yes the UI and other things have improved drastically in 2.8
- Losing a track/car and restarting is too costly.
- I almost certainly won't be switching from 2.79 to 2.80 in the middle of a project.
