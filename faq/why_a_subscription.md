# Why Subscription Based

Having a one-time fee works for one-off games, or for creating and selling sequels each year. The Racing Simulation will be developed for many years with constant updates for more realistic and immersive features. Another approach considered was to have paid downloadable content (DLC), however this has the potential to lead into a situation where content get rushed out, with lower quality, to get money flowing in. The subscription cost for an entire year is about the same as a couple visits to a movie theatre, an arguably provides more value.
