# Don't be  a Backseat Developer

I really do appreciate suggestions and tips. But when you give them, make sure you have a solid explanation as to why I should choose your method over another. Give me the pros and cons of each situation, including the downsides of your suggestion.

Simply stating your idea and saying "this should be done like ____" is not helpful because I have no idea why it should be that way or what the downsides are of doing it that way.
