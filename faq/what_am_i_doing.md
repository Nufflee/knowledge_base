# What is Happening?

**Designing 14 to 21 racing games!** I am resetting back to 2018 with the goal of producing games from concept to release; _ie **finishing** games_. These games should take 12 to 16 weeks which allows for approximately 350-500 hours of development per game.

## Primary Objectives

- Finishing games, improving quality over time
- Attracting players, building an audience over time
- Improving technology features, tools, integrations
- Gaining experience in designing racing games

To learn more lessons and challenges about finishing games to ensure overtime the games become better and risk of failure gets reduced. Building

## Worried about Quality

I do not wish to create games with the level of quality Archer contained; however I need to **finish** games before I can **finish good** games. The experience of completing concept to release is more important at this time, and I lost track of that with Rally of Rockets.

The following should help increase quality:

- New TurtleBrains features; UI Menus
- 3D games have Sky, Shadows and Environment Mapping from template
- Better deployment strategies
- Simply being aware of things, lessons learned

## Worried about Over Scoping

Initially Rally of Rockets was to be completed and shipped in 4 months. The feeling of releasing low quality became overwhelming and the scope **exploded**. Developments time and costs increased drastically beyond confidence in seeing returns so the project was put on hold.

To ensure this doesn't happen again:

- Set **hard** restrictions to development time of a project; like Archer
	- Do **not** adjust time afterwards
- Design very small games
- Iterate on previous games to grow over time

Any ideas on how to reduce the concerns about quality and over-scoping?
