# What is Happening?

**Designing 14 to 21 racing games!** I am resetting back to 2018 with the goal of producing games from concept to release; _ie **finishing** games_. These games should take 12 to 16 weeks which allows for approximately 350-500 hours of development per game. **The next game will be starting on _or before_ July 1st 2019.** Before that I am focused on building new skills in art, marketing and more as well as improving technology before diving straight into this next project.

## Primary Objectives

- Finishing games, improving quality over time
- Attracting players, building an audience over time
- Improving technology features, tools, integrations
- Gaining experience in designing racing games

To learn more lessons and challenges about finishing games to ensure that overtime the games become better and risk of failure gets reduced.

## Worried about Quality

I do not wish to create games with the level of quality Archer contained; however I need to **finish** games before I can **finish good** games. The experience of completing concept to release is more important at this time, and I lost track of that with Rally of Rockets.

The following should help increase quality:

- New TurtleBrains features; UI Menus
- 3D games have Sky, Shadows and Environment Mapping from template
- Better deployment strategies
- Simply being aware of things, lessons learned

## Worried about Over Scoping

Initially Rally of Rockets was to be completed and shipped in 4 months. The feeling of releasing low quality became overwhelming and the scope **exploded**. Developments time and costs increased drastically beyond confidence in seeing returns so the project was put on hold.

To ensure this doesn't happen again:

- Set **hard** restrictions to development time of a project; like Archer
	- Do **not** adjust time afterwards
- Design very small games
- Iterate on previous games to grow over time

Any ideas on how to reduce the concerns about quality and over-scoping?

## Worried about the Racing Simulator

The racing simulator is a huge project and going at it without more experience releasing projects in the first place seems like an unwise decision. Still it is the star project in the indie adventure and so it must not be sidelined forever.

To ensure this remains in focus:

- At least 10 hours of focus/effort every month
	- planning, design, art, etc.
	- tools, engine dev, physics, etc.
	- skill building, learning, etc.
- Can do this in a weekend / few mornings a month.
- Can be placed end of month A and start of month B to reduce context change.
