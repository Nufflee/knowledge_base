# Out Of Scope

I _really_ appreciate all ideas/suggestions that you Turtles toss my way. However I cannot and will not implement all ideas for the following reasons:

## 1. Cohesive Design

Some ideas just do not fit the overall vision for the game or project. That doesn't mean the idea is bad. If I took every good idea and smashed it into a project, it would be a giant hairball. Messy and incohesive.

## 2. Time is Money

I am trying to do make games and creations as a business to support myself to continue making games. Simply put, time costs money. Implementing even the most _"simple"_ of ideas take a **lot** of time, and thus money. I will weigh what I perceive the value gain _(for the project)_ per effort _(of development)_ is to the best of my ability.
