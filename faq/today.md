# Today is 2019-05-23

## Objectives for the day:

- Jump into Blender and figure out how to edit the exporter.
- Get the exporter to apply Translation, Scale and Rotation during export automagically.
- Get exporter to apply material colors as vertex colors (as an option)

## Purpose

- To make exporting art easier, and save time lost to bad exports from unapplied transforms.
- Using materials will improve work-flow during art creation, easier color modifications.
