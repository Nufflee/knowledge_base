## Adobe Photoshop Tricks:
- When setting up Photoshop "for first time" You will need to do the following to get it to behave normally...
1. Window > Workspace > Keyboard shortcuts & Menus > Shortcuts
2. Set "Step Backward" to Ctrl+Z
3. Set "Undo/Redo" to Alt+Ctrl+Z
4. Ensure "Step Foreward" is set to Shift+Ctrl+Z

B for brush mode
	While in brush-mode alt click = eye dropper
CTRL-D for deselect
Window > Workspace > Keyboard shortcuts & Menus > Menus - this allows you to color the menu items which could make things easier to find.

If accidental bad tolerance, place a layer underneath and paint with the background color, then merge down

Check / Uncheck "Auto-Select" use the movement tool and there is an option on the top (tool options) for this.
> If enabled Photoshop seems to auto-guess what layer you want to move around.

Control brackets "[ ]" to move a layer up/down the layert list.
