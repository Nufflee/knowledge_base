# Adobe Photoshop Tricks:

## Setup (the way it should be)
> When setting up Photoshop "for first time" You will need to do the following to get it to behave normally with undo/redo.
1. Window > Workspace > Keyboard shortcuts & Menus > Shortcuts
2. Set "Step Backward" to Ctrl+Z
3. Set "Undo/Redo" to Alt+Ctrl+Z
4. Ensure "Step Foreward" is set to Shift+Ctrl+Z

## Setting up a color palette
1. Delete each color swatch from the current palette.  
(_This involved painfully right-clicking each color, choosing delete, accepting._)  
Feel free to use the [black_and_white.aco](../config/adobe_photoshop/black_and_white.aco)
2. Sample a color from the image  
_or_ click color tab and select your desired color.
3. Add the color to the swatches palette.  
Click in the empty area of swatches palette to add the color.
4. When done adding colors, save the set in the swatch palette hamburg menu, `Save Swatches`

> Loading a swatch palette with `Load Swatches...` seems to append to the present palette so it may be desirable to use `Replace Swatches...` instead.

## Tools and Usage

### Brush Tool:
- Hotkey: `b`
- Purpose: Paint all over the canvas with pen.
	- Holding `alt` will change temporarily to color picker, eye dropper.

## Random Useful Hotkeys / Uses
- Deselect anything select with `CTRL+D`
- Move the current layer up or down in layer list with `CTRL+[` or `CTRL+]`

## Random Tips
- Window > Workspace > Keyboard shortcuts & Menus > Menus - this allows you to color the menu items which could make things easier to find.
- If accidental bad tolerance, place a layer underneath and paint with the background color, then merge down
- Check / Uncheck "Auto-Select" for the movement tool. Option is on the top of the canvas area _(in movement tool)_.
	> When enabled Photoshop seems to auto-guess what layer you want to move around.
